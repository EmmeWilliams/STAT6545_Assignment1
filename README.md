# STAT6545_Assignment1

This repository contains the code for Stats 6545 Project 1 by Emmeline Williams.

The .ipynb file is a Jupyter notebook containing all code, plots, and text for this project.
To reproduce all plots, download the file and run all cells. Plots will be saved as pdfs
in your working directory.

Alternatively, the three .py files are Python scripts, one for each question of the project.
Each contains only the raw Python script. Running each one will reproduce the plots for the
associated question, saving them as pdfs.

The submitted version of the assignment with text and plots is included as a pdf file.
